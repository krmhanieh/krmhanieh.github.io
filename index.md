Salam! I'm a 3rd-year PhD student in Space Science at the University of New Hampshire. I am currently pursuing my PhD under the advisorship of [Matthew Argall](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-argall), working on the project:  

**Relative Entropy in Reconnection and Turbulence_Quantifying Its Characteristics and the Influence of Electromagnetic Fields**

Using data from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, my research focuses on identifying and quantifying key mechanisms of energy conversion in collisionless plasmas, such as [magnetic reconnection](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/20310/) and turbulence. While energy transfer is traditionally linked to the second moment of the Vlasov-Maxwell equation, this approach does not account for changes in higher-order moments. The distribution function can also change shape, representing a previously overlooked energy source.  

By formulating <span style="color: navy;">energy transfer using relative entropy</span>, my work incorporates these higher-order contributions, providing a more comprehensive understanding of entropy-driven energy conversion in space plasmas.

I initially started my PhD with the intention of studying high-energy astrophysics, but after taking my graduate course in statistical physics, I stumbled upon interesting projects related to entropy. This curiosity, combined with my growing interest in space physics, led me to focus on entropy in magnetic reconnection and turbulence.  

I am lucky to be pursuing my PhD during solar cycle 25, where I get to witness maximum solar activity—and, even more amazingly, I experienced a total solar eclipse when I was part of the Citizen Continental-America Telescope Eclipse CATE 2024.

If I'm not doing research, I'm [running](/everything-else/)! I ended up with a pair of running shoes and have been running ever since—I've raced two marathons and intend to do more.  

I have also developed a love for CrossFit as an explosive and fun workout—It has made me much faster! 

I have a deep love for [analog photography](/everything-else/#My Expired film photography) and enjoy capturing moments on film.
